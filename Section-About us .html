	<TD><SPAN style= "color: 'Black'; font-family: Bradley Hand; font-size: 24px;"> Hi, my name is Christopher. I think people in middle school might just know me already because I'm like, well, erm... annoying? At least that's what people say. I like Star Wars but I don't know ALL THE THINGS about it. My favorite character is C-3PO because he's as annoying as me and he knows how to insult people. My favorite book of all time is the Inheritance Cycle, so I shouldn't be saying "my favourite book", but hey! I feel like it! Right, you guys are probably annoyed right now because I keep going in circles. I haven't even got to my birthday and age yet! I mean, like, without me saying my birthday, I'm protecting myself. (The words "Birthday boy!" really embarrass me). If you really wanna know my birthday, come and talk to me. YOU THINK I WAS SERIOUS!? NO! Fine. MAYBE I'll tell you about my birthday. It's on April 74. There. See? It's not too bad... I'm twelve and I'm in 7tth grade as a hopefully not too annoying kid. (That was weird, I just went against my point. One second I'm annoying and the next second I'm hopefully not.) Well, I have to start writing because my teammate is like: "Dude, I'm not putting that in." I'll end fast without a speech. BYE! ðŸ¤ª.</SPAN></TD>
